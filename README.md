This repository originated from my curiosity: how many routable IPv4 addresses does Italy actually have? Some Italian ISPs no longer allocate independent IPv4 addresses.

This result is based on the database of https://iptoasn.com/

If you don't want to run the code, the result is: Italy has 52,128,952 routable IPv4 addresses.


According to the data as of September 2021, Italy has approximately 52,128,952 routable IPv4 addresses, while the population is around 60,360,000. Therefore, the ratio of IPv4 addresses to the population in Italy is approximately 0.863:1, meaning that each person in Italy has approximately 0.863 IPv4 addresses.
